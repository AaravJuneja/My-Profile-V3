# My-Profile-V3

Hello! I'm Aarav, a web developer and student currently studying in Class 9 J at Amity International School, Sector 46, Gurgaon. With a deep love for coding and technology, I've embarked on an exciting journey in the world of web development. My fascination with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript led me to create dynamic and interactive websites. As I explore frameworks like React and server-side technologies like Node.js, I am driven by a desire to create engaging digital experiences. My interests extend to graphic design, allowing me to craft visually appealing websites. Beyond coding, you can find me immersing myself in tech blogs, playing basketball, and capturing the beauty of nature through photography. I am eager to continue my growth as a web developer, taking on challenges that push my skills to new heights. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing web development, feel free to connect with me through the provided contact options. Let's make something extraordinary together!
